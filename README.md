# Volume Fade

**Volume Fade** is a simple application for comfortable falling asleep with music, videos, or audiobooks.

If you like to fall asleep while listening to YouTube, radio, or music, but don’t want sound playing all night — Volume Fade solves this problem.

## Features

- Set a delay before volume fading starts
- Smooth volume fade-out to silence over a selected time
- Pause and resume fade-out
- Restore the original volume with one button
- Minimalist night-friendly interface
- User actions always have priority (manual volume change stops the fade)

## How It Works

1. Start music, video, or audiobook
2. Set the delay before fading begins
3. Set the fade-out duration
4. Press **Start Fade**
5. The volume will gradually decrease to silence

If you manually change the volume during fade-out, the process stops automatically — user control always comes first.

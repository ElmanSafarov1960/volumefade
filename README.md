## How It Works

1. **Start** your favorite media (YouTube, music, audiobook).
2. **Set the delay** (how long to play at full volume).
3. **Set the fade duration** (how slowly the sound should disappear).
4. **Press START FADE**.
5. Watch the **Current Media Volume** slider gradually move to zero.

If you need to stop everything and close the app, use the **STOP & EXIT** button.

## 🛠 Fixing Background Issues (Android)

Android systems often close background apps to save battery. If the volume stops fading when the screen is off, follow these steps after pressing **"FIX BACKGROUND ERRORS"**:

1. Find **Volume Fade** in the app list that opens.
2. Select **"Don't optimize"** or **"No restrictions"** for battery usage.
3. Ensure **"Background activity"** is allowed.

This ensures the fade-out service continues to work smoothly while you sleep
